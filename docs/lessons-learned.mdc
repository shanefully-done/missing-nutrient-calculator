### Layout Restructuring: Moving Links from Footer to Header

**Date**: 2025-07-15

**Before**: 
- GitHub and Blog links were positioned in the footer
- Footer was located at the bottom of the page
- Language switcher was isolated in the header area
- Layout was simple but navigation links were separated from main interaction area

**After**:
- GitHub and Blog links moved to header, positioned inline with language switcher
- Created new `HeaderNav` component (`components/header-nav.tsx`) as client component
- Links and language switcher now share the same flex container
- Responsive design implemented:
  - Desktop: Horizontal layout (links + language switcher in same row)
  - Mobile: Vertical stack (links below language switcher)
- Footer completely removed for cleaner layout

**Technical Implementation**:
- Used client component (`"use client"`) for HeaderNav to access translation system
- Leveraged existing translation keys from `lib/translations.ts`
- Applied consistent styling using Tailwind CSS responsive utilities
- Maintained security attributes (target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer")

**Key Insights**:
- **Component Architecture**: Creating dedicated client components for navigation allows better separation of concerns
- **Responsive Design**: Using Tailwind's responsive utilities (hidden sm:block, sm:hidden) provides clean mobile/desktop switching
- **Translation Integration**: Client components can access the language context directly, making translation implementation straightforward
- **Layout Efficiency**: Moving navigation links to the header improves discoverability and reduces vertical space usage

**Code Patterns Used**:
```typescript
// Responsive visibility pattern
className="hidden sm:block" // Desktop only
className="sm:hidden" // Mobile only

// Flex container for inline positioning
<div className="flex items-center gap-4">
  <a>...</a>
  <a>...</a>
  <LanguageSwitcher />
</div>
```

**Future Considerations**:
- Consider adding hover states or active indicators for better UX
- Evaluate if additional navigation items would benefit from this pattern
- Monitor for any accessibility issues with the new layout
